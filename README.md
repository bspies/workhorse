WorkHorse
=========

WorkHorse is a Java-based workflow engine that implements key concepts of [BPMN 2.0](http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/), [petri nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net), and [workflow patterns](workflowpatterns.com).

Current Roadmap:
----------------
* A BPMN 2.0-based workflow engine
* A domain-specific language for describing BPMN diagrams that is similar to the DOT language.
* A browser-based BPMN designer.
* Support for running in distributed environments.
